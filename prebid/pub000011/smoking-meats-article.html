For this reason, I recommend you monitor the internal temperature of these and check the tenderness once they reach about 135\u00b0F which is a good medium rare. If they happen to be tender at 135 then they are ready to eat. If they are still tough as shoe leather, then you likely have some made from the chuck roast and they will need to be cooked to about 185 or so. From my research, it seems that most of them are chuck and will take 4-5 hours of smoky heat to tenderize them but I did want to caution you to make sure.","url":"https:\/\/www.smoking-meat.com\/october-30-2014-smoked-beef-country-style-ribs#wprm-recipe-24919-step-4-0"}]},{"@type":"HowToSection","name":"Smoking the Beef Country Style Ribs","itemListElement":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Place the Bradley rack on the smoker grate or place the meat directly on the smoker grate and let the smoking begin.","url":"https:\/\/www.smoking-meat.com\/october-30-2014-smoked-beef-country-style-ribs#wprm-recipe-24919-step-5-0"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Be sure to use a digital probe meat thermometer to monitor the temperature.","url":"https:\/\/www.smoking-meat.com\/october-30-2014-smoked-beef-country-style-ribs#wprm-recipe-24919-step-5-1"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"When the meat reaches about 135 \u00b0F (about 1 to 1.5 hours), check it for tenderness by sticking a toothpick or thermometer probe into it.

<p>In this recipe, I created a marinade, which I will share with you below, that puts a lot of wonderful flavor into them in just a few short hours or overnight to help bring out that amazing beef flavor that we all love so much.</p>
<p>I do love doing these and I haven't done any for a very long time so I figured it was 'bout time!</p>

<div id="PrettyHeader"><b>An Important Note About Beef Country Style Ribs</b></div>
<p>I have been smoking this cut for long enough to know that every location and butcher does them a little different. Interestingly enough, they all tend to look similar but some of them are cut from the chuck roast while others are cut from more tender parts.</p>
<p>For this reason, I recommend you monitor the internal temperature of these and check the tenderness once they reach about 135°F which is a good medium rare.</p>
<p>If they happen to be tender at 135°F then they are ready to eat. If they are still tough as shoe leather, then you likely have some made from the chuck roast and they will need to be cooked to about 185 or so.</p>
<p>From my research, it seems that most of them are chuck and will take 4-5 hours of smoky heat to tenderize them but I did want to caution you to make sure.</p>
<p>A great tool for checking the temperature on these is the <strong>improved</strong> <a href="http://www.thermoworks.com/ThermoPop?tw=SMOKINGMEAT">ThermoPop digital pocket thermometer</a> which <strong>reads in 3-4 seconds</strong> (that's fast), is <strong>splash-proof</strong> and is being offered now for <strong>only $29</strong>. One of my favorite toys.. er, tools;-)</p>

<p>Be sure to use a <a href="https://www.smoking-meat.com/smoke" title="Smoke 2-Channel Alarm Thermometer by Thermoworks" class="pretty-link-keyword" rel="" target="_blank">digital probe meat thermometer</a> to monitor the temperature.</p>
<p>When the meat reaches about 135°F (about 1 to 1.5 hours), check it for tenderness by sticking a toothpick or thermometer probe into it. If it feels tender, remove a piece of the meat and cut/taste it to see where you are as described above in the &#8220;<strong>Important Note</strong>&#8220;.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16766" src="https://www.smoking-meat.com/image-files/2014-IMG_5781.jpg" alt="2014-IMG_5781" width="250" height="167" srcset="https://www.smoking-meat.com/image-files/2014-IMG_5781-84x55.jpg 84w, https://www.smoking-meat.com/image-files/2014-IMG_5781-120x80.jpg 120w, https://www.smoking-meat.com/image-files/2014-IMG_5781.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" /></p>
<p>If it is done, then all is well.</p>
<p>If it is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> done, continue to smoke cook the meat until it is tender to your liking. This can take as many as 4-5 hours in some cases.</p>
<p>I recommend wrapping them in foil for a couple of hours to help them tenderize more.</p>

<div id="PrettyHeader"><b>Sear the Outside on the Grill (optional)</b></div>
<p>Once my beef ribs were done cooking in the smoker, I immediately placed them on a very hot grill to get a little sear on the outside and, in my opinion, it was worth it.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16768" src="https://www.smoking-meat.com/image-files/2014-IMG_5799.jpg" alt="2014-IMG_5799" width="250" height="167" srcset="https://www.smoking-meat.com/image-files/2014-IMG_5799-84x55.jpg 84w, https://www.smoking-meat.com/image-files/2014-IMG_5799-120x80.jpg 120w, https://www.smoking-meat.com/image-files/2014-IMG_5799.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" /></p>
<p>Brush some of <a href="https://www.smoking-meat.com/order" title="Order Recipes" class="pretty-link-keyword" rel="" target="_blank">my sauce</a> on the outside and let them cook for about 4 minutes on each side putting them at the 2 o'clock position first for about 2 minutes then at the 10 o'clock position for a couple of minutes to get perfect 90 degree sear marks on the outside.</p>
<p>Flip them over and repeat the 2 and 10 position to get the good looking and tasty sear on the other side.</p>

<div id="PrettyHeader"><b>Serve it Up</b></div>
<p>Serve the beef CSR ribs immediately.</p>
<div id="PrettyHeader"><b>Questions</b></div>
<p><strong>Do I have to marinate the meat? </strong></p>
<p>No. The marinating step is completely optional. The ribs will be good even if you don't but I do highly recommend that you do if possible.</p>
<p><strong>If it becomes obvious that the meat will need longer cooking times, how long and when to wrap in foil? </strong></p>
<p>When the meat reaches about 160°F is a great time to wrap the meat in foil or optionally, place it in a foil pan covered with foil. Leave the meat wrapped in the foil until it reaches about 185°F or when you determine that it is tender to your liking. Then place the meat on the grill (as described above) for a few minutes to add some great flavor and color to the outside. This is also a great time to brush with some of my delicious barbecue sauce (<a href="https://www.smoking-meat.com/order">purchase recipes here</a>) if you so desire.</p>
<p><b>How do you recommend serving the meat?</b></p>
<p>I have been known to just give each person an entire &#8220;rib&#8221; but I also like to slice it thin and place it on top of a vegetable salad.<br />

<div class="tan-box"><em>"Love the sauce and <a href="https://www.smoking-meat.com/order" title="Order Recipes" class="pretty-link-keyword" rel="" target="_blank">rub recipes</a>. So far I have used them on beef ribs, pork ribs, and different chicken parts. Can't wait to do a beef brisket. Texas rub is great as well!" <strong>~Peter S.</strong></em></div>
<div class="tan-box"><em>"I tried the rub on a beef brisket and some beef ribs the other day and our entire family enjoyed it tremendously. I also made a batch of the barbeque sauce that we used on the brisket as well as some chicken. We all agreed it was the best sauce we have had in a while." <strong>~Darwyn B.</strong></em></div>
<div class="tan-box"><em>"Love the original rib rub and sauce! We have an annual rib fest competition at the lake every 4th of July. I will say we have won a great percent of the time over the past 15 years so we are not novices by any means. However, we didn't win last year and had to step up our game!

Interestingly enough, they all tend to look similar but some of them are cut from the chuck roast while others are cut from more tender parts. For this reason, I recommend you monitor the internal temperature of these and check the tenderness once they reach about 135°F which is a good medium rare. If they happen to be tender at 135 then they are ready to eat. If they are still tough as shoe leather, then you likely have some made from the chuck roast and they will need to be cooked to about 185 or so. From my research, it seems that most of them are chuck and will take 4-5 hours of smoky heat to tenderize them but I did want to caution you to make sure.</div> </li></ul></div><div class="wprm-recipe-instruction-group"><h4 class="wprm-recipe-group-name wprm-recipe-instruction-group-name wprm-block-text-bold">Smoking the Beef Country Style Ribs</h4><ul class="wprm-recipe-instructions"><li id="wprm-recipe-24919-step-5-0" class="wprm-recipe-instruction" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><div class="wprm-recipe-instruction-text" style="margin-bottom: 5px">Place the <a href="https://www.smoking-meat.com/bradley-racks" title="Bradley Racks" class="pretty-link-keyword" rel="" target="_blank">Bradley rack</a> on the smoker grate or place the meat directly on the smoker grate and let the smoking begin.</div> </li><li id="wprm-recipe-24919-step-5-1" class="wprm-recipe-instruction" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><div class="wprm-recipe-instruction-text" style="margin-bottom: 5px">Be sure to use a <a href="https://www.smoking-meat.com/smoke" title="Smoke 2-Channel Alarm Thermometer by Thermoworks" class="pretty-link-keyword" rel="" target="_blank">digital probe meat thermometer</a> to monitor the temperature.</div> </li><li id="wprm-recipe-24919-step-5-2" class="wprm-recipe-instruction" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><div class="wprm-recipe-instruction-text" style="margin-bottom: 5px">When the meat reaches about 135 °F (about 1 to 1.5 hours), check it for tenderness by sticking a toothpick or thermometer probe into it.
