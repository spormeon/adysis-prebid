    p>“My math is different from anyone else,” Phil Mickelson told reporters ahead of the British Open at Royal Birkdale.
<br>
It seems, much like his math was different in 2013 when he unleashed the Phrankenwood, Mickelson’s Open calculations have again returned a different result.
<br>
Lefty looks to be scrapping the driver in favor of a Callaway Epic 3-iron bent to 16 degrees, per a Golf Channel report. He will also carry a 3-wood this week; it’s a 13.5-degree Callaway GBB Epic Sub Zero with a Mitsubishi Fubuki K 70X shaft.
<br>
Mickelson has carried an Apex UT 3-iron this year, which he’ll reportedly keep in the bag in addition to the driving iron.
<br>
Interestingly, we also spotted Mickelson testing an insert-less putter, deviating from his Odyssey Versa #9 White with a Microhinge Insert.</p>
