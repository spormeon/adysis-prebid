What i'm looking to do is combine the "test page" with the "video test page", so as each slot bids on banner, native, outstream & instream.  "test page" currently runs banner, native and outstream in prebid "multi format" units but you can have outstream and instream in multi format units, so the idea is to create the auction and depending on the highest bid, display that bid, so i think it needs some logic around the instream winning, if instream wins , it displays in the unit.
<br><br>
The video test page, I have made from my knowledge, im not sure if its the best or quickest for speed, someone told me i dont need both ima and mailonline vast, which it currently uses.  There is a demo video in dfp (the golf video, on a frequency cap), that shows in this so, as i could test sending vids to it from prebid and there are not many bids that come back for the prebid part.
<br><br>
so in effect, im trying to combine all this lot into one script file, so as to get the best competition overall.  on the instream, the plan is to get bids, render the ad, then have a 1-2 sec video sat behind it, so in effect its a pre-roll with virtually no video behind it, so just getting the advert value,  i've seen others do this.
<br><br>
one other thing i'm looking to do is instead of having 4 blocks of bidders in the script, i'm looking to have 1 block of bidders and make them bid on the 4 slots, just so i have to anly maintain 1 block of bidders 9easier to make chnages, add bidders etc), not sure if this can be done/ how to do it.
<br><br>
also generally speed up and tidy up the script.  i'd also like to split the script out, so as its easier to chnage certain parts from some config files,  i've started to look at https://requirejs.org/ , so as to make it into modules ( bidders, bidder setting, timeouts, floor prices, stats collect, bidfilter script etc)
